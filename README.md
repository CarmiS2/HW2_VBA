# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset of several green energy stocks and how they performed in 2018 and 2017. Additionally, we want to build out a code that can be applied to additional years and larger data. In order to find the overall performance of these stocks we calculated the total daily volume and yearly return. 

## Results 
Analyzing that data, we were able to automate the calculations needed to find the total daily volume and yearly return for the stocks within our data sets using VBA. Through this use of code and conditional formatting we were able to easily see that these most of the green energy stock did much better in 2017 then 2018, most saw a low return in 2018. Only two companies saw a positive return both in 2017 and 2018. 
When running the original set of code for our dataset, the execution time to run the calculation needed was around 1.45 seconds. Once we have refactored the code, to better accommodate larger datasets, the execution time improved significantly.

## Summary: 
The advantages of refactoring code is not only to improve the codes execution time and structure but also improve the scalability from the original code we created. Disadvantages of refactoring code is the potential for bugs. Refactoring the original VBA script we saw an overall improvement in the execution time, so we can be confident that the refactor code will be able to process larger datasets. Cons was the additional time and bugs that I had to work through to get our script to preform correctly.
